## 🎯 The Challenge

**GRC teams spend 70%+ of their time on data transformation, not risk analysis.**

Every compliance audit follows the same painful pattern:
- Security engineers export data from cloud platforms
- Hours spent manually formatting JSON/CSV files
- Copy-pasting into Excel templates
- Mapping findings to compliance frameworks
- Inevitable human errors requiring rework

**What if this could be automated?**

## 💡 The Solution

This educational demo shows how to automatically transform Google Cloud Platform (GCP) security data into audit-ready Excel reports that compliance teams can immediately use. No more manual data wrangling. No more formatting nightmares.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/securedbyjc/gcp-audit-evidence-demo.git
cd gcp-audit-evidence-demo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r exporter/requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python exporter/main.py

# Output appears in timestamped folder
# output/2025-01-15_143022/audit_report.xlsx
```

**That's it!** In under 10 seconds, you have a formatted Excel workbook ready for auditors.

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Automated Data Transformation
- Ingests GCP Security Command Center findings
- Processes SIEM events and alerts  
- Integrates CISA ScubaGoggles assessments
- Outputs formatted Excel with multiple views

### 📊 Comprehensive Framework Mapping (20+ Controls)
Our educational demo includes mappings across **5 major compliance frameworks**:

- **NIST 800-53** - Federal standard controls (AC, AU, SC, IA, etc.)
- **CMMC 2.0** - Defense contractor requirements (Level 2 & 3 practices)
- **FedRAMP** - Cloud service authorization (Low/Moderate/High baselines)
- **SOC 2** - Service organization controls (CC, A, C criteria)
- **ISO 27001** - International security standard (Annex A controls)

#### Control Categories Covered:
- **Access Control** - Identity, authentication, and authorization
- **Data Protection** - Encryption, classification, and storage security
- **Network Security** - Boundary protection and segmentation
- **Audit & Accountability** - Logging, monitoring, and review
- **Incident Response** - Detection, handling, and reporting
- **Identity Management** - Account lifecycle and privileged access
- **Configuration Management** - Baselines and change control
- **Risk Management** - Assessment and vulnerability scanning
- **System Maintenance** - Patching and updates

### 📁 Evidence Bundle Generation
- Timestamped audit packages
- Hyperlinked evidence files
- Screenshot integration
- Complete audit trail

### 🎨 Professional Excel Output
- **Color-coded severity ratings** (Critical=Red, High=Orange, Medium=Yellow)
- **Colored worksheet tabs** by compliance category
- **Executive summary dashboard** with metrics
- **Auto-formatted columns** with borders and headers
- **Dynamic tab creation** based on control categories
- **Print-ready reports** for auditor review
  
## 🎬 Live Demo

<div align="center">

### Before: Raw Security Data (JSON)
```json
{
  "finding": {
    "rule_id": "PUBLIC_GCS_BUCKET",
    "resource": "//storage.googleapis.com/sensitive-data",
    "severity": "HIGH",
    "compliance_violation": true
  }
}
```

### After: Audit-Ready Excel
| Finding | NIST Control | CMMC Practice | Severity | Evidence |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| Public Storage Bucket | AC-3 | AC.L2-3.1.2 | 🔴 HIGH | [Link](./evidence) |
